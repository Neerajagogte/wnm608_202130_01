			<p>We are the sixth largest home furniture manufacturer in the United States, principally involved in design and manufacture of home furniture products and specialising in the design of Sofa chairs, tables and shelves. Our customers are mainly retailers, chain stores and traders.

			<br><br>
			Most of our home furniture products are exported. There are more than 10 countries which we have been exporting consistently since 2012.

			The company pioneered tough, shiny tables and cabinets laminated with a virtually indestructible polyester finish in the mid-1980s and stood out in the industry for the daring of its contemporary designs and colors. We maintain manufacturing facilities in Iowa, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Florida, and California. We also also own an upholstery plant in Singapore. We manufacture approximately two-thirds of its products, with the remaining third imported from Asia and also license a chain of online stores called TealSpace Furniture , with close to 40 physical stores operated by independent dealers in areas where the company does not otherwise have strong distribution. </p>
